                <img src="./chairs/19/mainimg.jpg" alt="ECJPMA Patio Chairs"><p> There are a variety of different chairs here on the PMA ECJ patio. There are concrete picnic tables and metal ones at a variety of distances from the road. You do hear traffic noise from Dean Keaton and the crowd is larger during the time between classes, however it's a nice place to sit outside near PMA and it's good for people watching if you like to do that. In addition it's close to the EER patio but a little more spread out. However, there isn't really much protection from rain. </p>

                <h3> <a href="./chairs/16/chair.php"> EER Rear Patio Chair</a></h3>
                <img src="./chairs/16/mainimg.jpg" alt="EER Rear Patio Chair"><p> This is a nice secluded spot. While it's near an intersection neither road gets much traffic and you get virtually no people using this area to get to their classes. The only time it might get noisy is if people use the sand volleyball field across San Jacinto, but I've never noticed a lot of noise. In addition, this area is not well known so there's usually free tables (I've never been there when there wasn't). The seating is comfortable, but there isn't much in the way of rain protection so keep that in mind.</p>

                <img src="./chairs/17/mainimg.jpg" alt="EER Patio Chairs"><p> This seating area is relatively peaceful though it can get busy in between classes. I have not tried to sit here during the rain but there does appear to be a covering. The chairs are comfortable and the view is good if you enjoy people watching. In addition, the tables are large enough to provide a good work space. During normal school operation there is also a cafe in this area although it is currently closed because of the virus.</p>
