Shannon:This seating area is relatively peaceful though it can get busy in between classes. I have not tried to sit here during the rain but there does appear to be a covering. The chairs are comfortable and the view is good if you enjoy people watching. In addition, the tables are large enough to provide a good work space. During normal school operation there is also a cafe in this area although it is currently closed because of the virus.
