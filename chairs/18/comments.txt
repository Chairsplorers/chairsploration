Shannon:EER is a great study space if you can get access (the trick is to make engineering friends). There tend to be unoccupied study rooms and there's lots of whiteboard-functioning glass or walls which is handy for working out tricky problems. They used to also have lots of fancy tables and chairs, but this has changed due to the virus and I'm unsure when the more comfy chairs will be back. This building does tend to have a quiet atmosphere that still allows for group work. The current chairs are comfortable for up to two hours.
