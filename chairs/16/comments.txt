Shannon:This is a nice secluded spot. While it's near an intersection neither road gets much traffic and you get virtually no people using this area to get to their classes. The only time it might get noisy is if people use the sand volleyball field across San Jacinto, but I've never noticed a lot of noise. In addition, this area is not well known so there's usually free tables (I've never been there when there wasn't). The seating is comfortable, but there isn't much in the way of rain protection so keep that in mind.
