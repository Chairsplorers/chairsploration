Shannon:There are a variety of different chairs here on the PMA ECJ patio. There are concrete picnic tables and metal ones at a variety of distances from the road. You do hear traffic noise from Dean Keaton and the crowd is larger during the time between classes, however it's a nice place to sit outside near PMA and it's good for people watching if you like to do that. In addition it's close to the EER patio but a little more spread out. However, there isn't really much protection from rain.
